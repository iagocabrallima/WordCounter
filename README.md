# WordCounter
# Overview

{This is one of my first personal projects, so I'm trying to learn the basics about more programming languages so I can be able to have more knowledge and be more flexible to my future employers needs and requirements.}

{That project its basic a word counter that reads a file and return all the words in the file and how many time they are repeated in the file.}

{My porpuse to wirte this software is to learn more about importing and reading files and also to learn more how to work with data}
